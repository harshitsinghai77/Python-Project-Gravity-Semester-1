# Semester 1 Python Project "Gravity"
> The objective of the game is to control a character or avatar to jump between platforms and avoid obstacles. Player has control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. Built on top of Pygame, the game uses various computer graphics and sound libraries to enhance user experience.

# Pygame
> Pygame (the library) is a Free and Open Source python programming language library for making multimedia applications like games built on top of the excellent SDL library. https://www.pygame.org

# Installation
> pip install pygame

> You should definitely begin by installing a binary package for your system. The binary packages usually come with or give the information needed for dependencies. Choose an appropriate installer for your system and version of python from the pygame downloads page. https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

> Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work will involve compiling and installing all the pygame dependencies. Once that is done run the "setup.py" script which will attempt to auto-configure, build, and install pygame.

# Clone the repo

# Dependencies
> Pygame is strongly dependent on SDL and Python. It also links to and embeds several other smaller libraries. The font module relies on SDL_tff, which is dependent on freetype. The mixer (and mixer.music) modules depend on SDL_mixer. The image module depends on SDL_image, which also can use libjpeg and libpng. The transform module has an embedded version of SDL_rotozoom for its own rotozoom function. The surfarray module requires the python numpy package for its multidimensional numeric arrays.

 # Prerequisite
 > * Pygame - Using pygame in-built functions makes several tasks like importing images, sounds, characters, and graphics much easier.
 > * Object Oriented Programming - To write efficient code. 
 
 # Controls

# Limitations
> Python is not a recommended language for making professional games. The graphics doesnâ€™t meet the demands of new generation gamers.

# Future Enhancements
> * Characters - Player will be allowed to choose from different characters.
> * Maps and Levels - Player can select different maps and levels.
